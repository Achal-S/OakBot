This folder contains ZIP files generated by OakbotDoclet.

* Each ZIP file contains a collection of XML files, which contain parsed Javadoc information of a particular library.
* Each XML file contains the Javadoc information of a single class.
* The ZIP file also contains a "info.xml" file, which contains information about the library itself.

=======================

To generate a ZIP file:

1. Compile the OakbotDoclet class.  You will need to include the JVM's "tools.jar" file on the classpath during compilation.  This file can be found at "$JAVA_HOME/lib/tools.jar"
2. Tweak the "build-zip.sh" file as necessary and then execute it.  Note that you'll need a copy of the library's source code on your computer.

=======================

I don't want to commit the ZIP for the Java 8 API to version control, due to its large file size (~6MB), so I've committed a smaller, sample file instead.
The sample ZIP file contains just a single class (java.lang.String).

The ZIP file for Java 8 can be downloaded here:
