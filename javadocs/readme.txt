This folder contains ZIP files generated by OakbotDoclet.

* Each ZIP file contains a collection of XML files, which contain parsed Javadoc information of a particular library.
* Each XML file contains the Javadoc information of a single class.
* The ZIP file also contains a "info.xml" file, which contains information about the library itself.

=======================

To generate these ZIP files, use the OakbotDoclet class, in conjunction with the "javadoc" command:

1. Modify the static fields at the top of the OakbotDoclet class as necessary.
2. Compile the OakbotDoclet class.  You will need to include the JVM's "tools.jar" file on the classpath.  This file can be found at "$JAVA_HOME/lib/tools.jar"
3. Run the following command:

javadoc \
-doclet oakbot.doclet.OakbotDoclet \
-docletpath target/classes:/home/user/.m2/repository/org/jsoup/jsoup/1.8.1/jsoup-1.8.1.jar \
-sourcepath ../java8-src \
-subpackages java \
-subpackages javax \
-subpackages org

-docletpath: This classpath string must contain the path to OabotDoclet.class and jsoup.
-sourcepath: The path to the library's source code

3. Then, copy the ZIP file it generates into this folder.

=======================

I don't want to commit the ZIP for the Java 8 API to version control, due to its large file size (~6MB), so I've committed a smaller, sample file instead.
The sample ZIP file contains just a single class (java.lang.String).

The ZIP file for Java 8 can be downloaded here:
